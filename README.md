## Why Did I Choose Vecāķi?
I chose the city of Vecaki in Latvia for my project because of its unique combination of natural beauty and cultural richness. Located by the sea, it offers a serene environment and stunning views, making it an ideal place for both relaxation and inspiration. During my time in Latvia, I had the opportunity to work at a wonderful restaurant called SAULES MEDNIEKS. The food there is absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting. The restaurant is located right by the seaside, offering not only great meals but also a beautiful view of the sea. I invite everyone to visit and experience it for themselves – you won't regret it!
